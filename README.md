# Dev Buddy

## Overview

A MERN stack web application made to help junior developers.

## Description

This app uses React and bootstrap for the front-end. Node.js and Express.js are used in the backend to save user info to MongoDB. 

It is aimed to help hopeful web developers learn the skills they need and therefore utilizes several APIs. For an unauthorized user, the resources tab displays general learning videos from the youtube API. The user is also able to enter a topic into the question form and the most relevant answers will be generated from the Stack Overflow API. 

In the articles page, articles are separated based on topic and are generated using the news API. 

Once a user has signed up, they are given access to a more specific set of resources in the resources tab calling for different API calls to be made. They are also now able to save the articles they choose and those will appear when the saved articles button is clicked.

User authentication was done using passport.js.
