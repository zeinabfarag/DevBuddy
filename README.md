## What Is Dev Buddy?

Dev Buddy is here for you on your journey to becoming a web developer. Whether you are a complete beginner, have dabbled in coding, or already have a background in it, Dev Buddy is here to help you with a plethora of resources including videos, helpful links, and articles.

Becoming a web developer has now become a whole lot easier.

## Why Web Development

Web developers are at the forefront of the Internet age. The websites we browse, the gifts we order and the news we peruse online are all made possible by the web developers who design,build and implement Internet websites.

They are heavily involved in website creation, from helping design aesthetic properties such as layout and color, to technical considerations such as how to design a website to handle a given amount of Internet traffic.

## Technologies Used

- Mongo (Database)
- Express.js
- React.js
- Node.js
- Passport.js (validation)
- Axios

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
yarn install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
yarn start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
